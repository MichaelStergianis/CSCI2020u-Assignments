	Masquerade

Description:

	A chat program that establishes a P2P connection and sends encrypted messages. If time permits we 
	would like to implement group chats with chat specific keys.

To run:

    Server :
        gradle runServer (by default this server will run on port 8020)
    Client :
        gradle runClient
        type in all fields
        type the username of someone with which you would like to chat
        having to type and spell their username is intentional
        you are not meant to be able to see those logged into an arbitrary server
